    "abstract": "Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it was designed from first principles to support an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several commonly used benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Linear-Time Construction of Suffix Trees We will present two methods for constructing suffix trees in detail, Ukkonen’s method and Weiner’s method. Weiner was the first to show that suffix trees can be built in linear time, and his method is presented both for its historical importance and for some different technical ideas that it contains. However, lJkkonen’s method is equally fast and uses far less space (i.e., memory) in practice than Weiner’s method Hence Ukkonen is the method of choice for most problems requiring the construction of a suffix tree. We also believe that Ukkonen’s method is easier to understand. Therefore, it will be presented first A reader who wishes to study only one method is advised to concentrate on it. However, our development of Weiner’s method does not depend on understanding Ukkonen’s algorithm, and the two algorithms can be read independently (with one small shared section noted in the description of Weiner’s method).",
